Vagrant/Puppet LAMP
==================

This will create a basic VM for local development, without crapping up your daily driver OS.

This is the spiritual successor to my previous article,
["Setting Up a VM, Step by Step"](https://jtreminio.com/2012/07/setting-up-a-debian-vm-step-by-step).

By default it sets up a copy of my [PuPHPet](http://puphpet.com) app. Simply add an entry in local hosts,
`192.168.123.101 puphpet.dev` and run `$ vagrant up` and within minutes you'll have a fully-functioning VM and website!

If you wish to quickly and easily setup your own, custom Vagrant/Puppet VM, go to [puphpet.com](http://puphpet.com),
my new GUI-based online configurator! Just point, click, and BOOM VM magic in your face!
